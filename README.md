# Pathfinding Visualization with Pygame

This project is a simple visualization of the Depth-First Search (DFS) algorithm for pathfinding on a grid, using Python and Pygame. It demonstrates how DFS explores a grid to find a path from one side to the other, marking the path it finds as the best path.

## Features

- Visualization of the DFS algorithm in real-time.
- Grid cells that change color based on their state (unvisited, visited, part of the best path).
- Adjustable grid size and cell dimensions for different levels of granularity.
- Simple Pygame window for easy visualization and interaction.

## Requirements

To run this project, you'll need:

- Python 3.6 or higher
- Pygame installed in your Python environment

You can install Pygame and run the project using pip:

```bash
pip install pygame
python main.py
